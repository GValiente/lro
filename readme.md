## To Do List

1. ✔️ Level Select Screens - 50+ puzzles and to select between (4 or 5 difficulty levels).
2. ❌ Different Suitcase select - having a cursor to select the item you want to move instead of tabbing through the suitcases will be a lot easier for most players.
3. ❌ Success Animation - making it more obvious when you have completed a puzzle, rather than just loading the next one.
4. ❌ Tutorial - how to play
5. ✔️ Save Progress - puzzle unlocking
6. ✔️ More Puzzles
7. ❌ Sliding animations of luggage
8. ❌ Dialog screens
